## 🧠 How the Game Works

- The player taps a card to flip it and reveal an image of an African American historical or cultural figure.
- The player then guesses who the person is by selecting from multiple‑choice answers.  
  (This helps players who may recognize the face but struggle with spelling or recalling the exact name.)
- Every correct answer earns **2 points**.
- Every **3 consecutive correct answers** awards an additional **+5 bonus points**.
- Every **5 correct answers** (not required to be consecutive) awards **1 puzzle piece**.
- Each puzzle contains **12 pieces**. Completing a puzzle unlocks a **collectible charm**.
- Charms provide special powers that can help the player during future rounds.
